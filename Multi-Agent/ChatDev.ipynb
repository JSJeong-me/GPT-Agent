This can happen when running the program in a headless or non-graphical environment, such as a server or command-line interface.\\n\\nTo resolve this issue, you have a few options:\\n\\n1. Run the program in a graphical environment: If you are running the program on a local machine, ensure that you are running it in a graphical environment, such as a desktop environment or window manager. This will provide the necessary display for the GUI elements to function properly.\\n\\n2. Use a virtual display: If you are running the program on a server or in a headless environment, you can use a virtual display, such as Xvfb, to create a simulated display. This allows you to run GUI programs without a physical display. You can install Xvfb and configure it to create a virtual display, then run your program within that display.\\n\\n3. Modify the program to run in a non-GUI mode: If a graphical interface is not necessary for your program, you can modify it to run in a non-GUI mode. This can be achieved by removing the GUI-related code and replacing it with a command-line interface or other text-based input/output.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the specific solution depends on your use case and the environment in which you are running the program.\"} |\n",

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |\n",
