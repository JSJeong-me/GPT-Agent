ADOR, a division of Hybe Corporation, released \"OMG\" for download and streaming on January 2, 2023. Park Jin-su produced the track and composed it with Ylva Dimberg and David Dawood. The lyrics, written by Dimberg, Gigi, and NewJeans member Hanni, were inspired by high school dramas and explore themes of young love, dedication, and one-sided affection. It blends R&B, hip hop, and pop, featuring hip-hop percussion, trap rhythms, and a UK garage-inflected groove. The song includes plucked staccato synth chords, skittering cowbells, and layered vocal harmonies and percussion.  \\nBuoyed by its viral success on the video-sharing platform TikTok, \"OMG\" peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Global 200, number seven on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, and number two on the South Korean Circle Digital Chart. It peaked at number one in Singapore and on Billboard\\'s Hits of the World '"
